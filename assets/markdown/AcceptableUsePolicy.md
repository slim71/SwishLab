### Enforcement

Any misuse of our AI Products or failure to adhere to the standards outlined in this Policy will

  Products and Services.

- **Legal Action**: In cases where the misuse of AI leads to significant harm, data breaches, or
  legal violations, we may pursue legal action against the party responsible. This could include
  reporting the incident to law enforcement or regulatory bodies.

- **Public Disclosure**: For incidents that impact public trust or involve severe ethical breaches,
  we reserve the right to publicly disclose the violation and the actions taken in response to
  maintain transparency and accountability.

### Commitment to Responsible AI
