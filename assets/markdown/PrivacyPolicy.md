***If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.***

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal
bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the
following legal bases to process your personal information:

- **Consent**. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to
  use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.

  necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at

use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be
inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can [withdraw your consent](#withdrawing-your-consent) at any
time.

In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your

- If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a
  timely way

- For investigations and fraud detection and prevention

- For business transactions provided certain conditions are met

- If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or
  settle an insurance claim

- For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin

- If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial
  abuse

- If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or
  the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to
  investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province

- If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court
  relating to the production of records

- If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and

  negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion

## 5. DO WE OFFER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED PRODUCTS?

***In Short***: *We offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine
learning, or similar technologies.*

As part of our Services, we offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence,

## 6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?

***In Short***: *If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account,
we may have access to certain information about you.*

Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media
account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive
certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we
receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name,
email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make
public on such a social media platform.

We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy
Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not
control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party
social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they
collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
their sites and apps.

## 7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

***In Short***: *We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined
in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.*

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out
in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping
your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## 8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

***In Short***: *We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and
technical security measures.*

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures
designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our
safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to
defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we
will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure
environment.

## 9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

***In Short***: *Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the
European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that
allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or
terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.*

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under
applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy
of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the
processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be
subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant
effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a
simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object
to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by
using the contact details provided in the
section "[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#14-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice)"
below.

We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
information, you also have the right to complain to
your [Member State data protection authority](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm)
or [UK data protection authority](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/).

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact
the [Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html).

### Withdrawing your consent

If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or
implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any
time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
provided in the
section "[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#14-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice)"
below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal
information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

### Account Information

If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your
account, you can:

- Log in to your account settings and update your user account.

- Contact us using the contact information provided.

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and
information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to

comply with applicable legal requirements.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us
at [slim71sv@gmail.com](mailto:slim71sv@gmail.com).

## 10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform
technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do
not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates
your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
Notice.

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there
currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not
respond to them at this time.

## 11. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?

***In Short***: *If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida,
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon,
Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request access to and
receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it,
correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the
right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information. These rights may be
limited in some circumstances by applicable law. More information is provided below.*
